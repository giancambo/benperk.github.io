# Debugging Azure Functions in Visual Studio

I wrote this article [here][LINK1] where I talk about how to debug and troubleshoot an Azure Bot service.  Since the development approaches are very similar between the Bot Service and an Azure Function, I wonder if this feature will ever support the Bot Service.  It would be much easier doing that versus the example I documented.  That would be cool.

You can download the Visual Studio Tools for Azure Functions [here][LINK2].

Then in Visual Studio select File –> New –> Cloud –> Azure Functions (Preview)
