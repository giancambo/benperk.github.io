# How to access KUDU using your Publishing Profile

If for some reason your Microsoft or Organizational credentials are not working when accessing KUDU, which I discuss here.  You can use your Publishing Profile userName and userPWD to connect.  You may get prompted with a page similar to that shown in Figure 1.

Once downloaded, open the *.PublishSettings file and look for the attributes named userName and userPWD and use them for the challenge/response pop-up, Figure 3, after clicking on the PUBLISHING CREDENTIALS link as shown previously in Figure 1.
