# Debugging Azure Functions in Visual Studio

This article has been migrated to its new home here: https://benperk.github.io/msdn/2017/2017-01-debugging-azure-funtions-in-visual-studio.html

I wrote this article here where I talk about how to debug and troubleshoot an Azure Bot service.  Since the development approaches are very similar between the Bot Service and an Azure Function, I wonder if this feature will ever support the Bot Service.  It would be much easier doing that versus the example I documented.  That would be cool.

You can download the Visual Studio Tools for Azure Functions here.

Then in Visual Studio select File –> New –> Cloud –> Azure Functions (Preview)

Nonetheless, look at this video where this capability is discussed.  Enjoy and give it a try.
