# How to connect a PowerShell client to the German Cloud

As you many know there is a new sovereign instance of Azure in Germany the the German Cloud.  #GermanCloud

There are some differences between then, for example you need a new subscription, the one for the public cloud does not transfer over, find out about that here.  Also, there is a different address for the Azure Germany German Cloud management portal, here it is.

However, this article is about connecting a PowerShell client to the German Cloud.  I wrote numerous other Azure related PowerShell articles, like the below:

+ Moving an Azure App Service
+ Deploy an App Service using Azure PowerShell to a Deployment Slot
+ How to tell which Azure PowerShell version you are running
+ Using KUDU with Microsoft Azure Web Apps
+ All my PowerShell articles

To connect your PowerShell client to the #GermanCloud #AzureGermanCloud #AzureSovereignCloud execute the following:

```
Login-AzureRmAccount -EnvironmentName AzureGermanCloud
Set-AzureRmContext -SubscriptionId "########-####-####-####-############"
```

After entering the Login-AzureRmAccount command which include the â€“EvironmentName of AzureGermanCloud you are prompted to enter your credentials.  Enter the credentials and, just in case you have multiple subscriptions in the German Cloud run the Set-AzureRmContext to the desired Subscription.  You should see something similar to that shown in Figure 1.
