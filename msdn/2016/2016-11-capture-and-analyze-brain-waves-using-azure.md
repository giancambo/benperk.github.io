# Capture and Analyze Brain Waves using Azure

I wrote [this][LINK1] article for the November 2016 [MSDN Magazine][LINK2], it is part one of a two part series.  Part two is coming next month, December 2016.

Part one of the article covers:

+ The configuration of Emotiv SDK
+ The configuration of the Azure IoT Hub

Part two of the article covers the remaining topics:

+ Creating the SQL Azure database and database table
+ Create and configure the Stream Analytics job
+ Exporting the data to Power BI for analysis

I have written a few other articles on similar topics like #BotFramework #CognitiveServices #Azure #BrainInterface #Emotiv #IoT #LUIS for example:

+ [Brain Interface data analysis][LINK3]
+ [Uploading my brain waves to the cloud, Azure IoT Hub and Emotiv brain interface][LINK4]
+ [What I learned from sleeping with the band][LINK5]
+ [Creating a Wi-Fi connection to my Lumia 640XL, with the Gadgeteer][LINK6]
+ [How to get started with using LUIS, Language Understanding Intelligent Service, Skype Bot][LINK7]
+ [Bot Framework 405 Method Not Allowed, 401 Unauthorized and 500, Internal Server Error getting started][LINK8]
