# Top 10 must have Phrase List Features for your chatbot or any bot LUIS

If you haven’t already read my other posts on creating my #chatbot, then check them out:

Anyway, in a post I am currently working on (How I improved my chatbot) I cover how I decided to create my LUIS entities.  Although the entities were good and they helped my chatbot #chatbot answer or respond to questions better, there are still some words missing.  So I looked for synonyms for my entities, shown in Figure 1 and added the synonymous.

###### Figure 1, LUIS entities for a #chatbot

Here is a table that contains the Phrase List for each of the Entities.



Then when I entered an utterance with a word that is in the LUIS Phrase List, it gets recognized in the window automatically, as shown in Figure 2.

If you look at the JSON output of the same question you see, that shown below.

```
{
  "query": "You have accomplished a lot",
  "topScoringIntent": {
    "intent": "None",
    "score": 0.489181966
  },
  "intents": [
    {
      "intent": "None",
      "score": 0.489181966
    },
    {
      "intent": "State",
      "score": 0.304426521
    },
    ...
  ],
  "entities": [
    {
      "entity": "accomplished",
      "type": "Good",
      "startIndex": 9,
      "endIndex": 20,
      "score": 0.9996033
    }
  ]
}
```

I can use both the Intent=None and Intent=State as the probabilities are high, the Entity Type: Good and the Entity entity: accomplished to provide a valid and quality response.

Now let’s go code some more stuff!  #AI #ArtificialIntelligence #Cognitive #BotServices #Azure
