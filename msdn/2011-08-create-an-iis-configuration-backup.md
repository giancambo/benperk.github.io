# Create an IIS configuration backup
The first step to take when making changes to a system is to backup what you currently have so that if there are problems with the system after the changes have applied, you have time constraints and canâ€™t get the system to work, then you have at least a backup of the systems state to reapply if required.

I don't generally like to rollback, none of us do, simply because of all the effort, planning and sacrifices required to get to the point where a release is possible. Nonetheless, always have a back-out plan...always.

To backup the IIS configuration using IIS 7+ machine perform the following.

Start a *Command Prompt* as an Administrator by right-clicking the icon and selecting *Run As Administrator*. Navigate to the windows working directory and then to the systems32\inetsrv and run the following command.

`appcmd add backup cleaninstall`

You should receive the below result:

![appcmd add backup cleaninstall][Figure1]

To rollback to the backed up configuration start a *Command Prompt* as an Administrator by richt-clicking the icon and selecting *Run As Administrator*. Navigate to the windows working directory and then to the system32\inetsrv directory and run the following command.

`appcmd restore backup cleaninstall`

You should receive the below result:

![appcmd restore backup cleaninstall](images/4848.2.png "Figure 2, appcmd restore backup cleaninstall")

After the restore, the IIS configuration will be in the state it was when the backup was originally taken.
