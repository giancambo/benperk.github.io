# Create an IIS configuration backup
The first step to take when making changes to a system is to backup what you currently have so that if there are problems with the system after the changes have applied, you have time constraints and canâ€™t get the system to work, then you have at least a backup of the systems state to reapply if required.

I don't generally like to rollback, none of us do, simply because of all the effort, planning and sacrifices required to get to the point where a release is possible. Nonetheless, always have a back-out plan...always.
