# Professional Microsoft IIS 8, co-author Benjamin Perkins

The [Professional Microsoft IIS 8][LINK1] book is now available, check it out.  I had the opportunity to contribute a few chapters to it.  What an awesome experience!  There are lots of examples, experiences, discussions and reviews of the new features found in IIS 8.  You can get an inside look at the contents on Amazon and download the source code examples at Wrox.com.
