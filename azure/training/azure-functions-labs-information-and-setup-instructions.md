# Azure Functions Labs – Information and setup instructions
I started my learning of Azure Functions, I.e. Service-less computing by writing this .NET Core Console application which calls the following Azure Functions each with a different trigger type.  I hosted the console application on GitHub here.  You will need the .NET Core runtime installed on your work station to run the console app, check this out.
